## PDF extractor 
Create extractor.py that:
1. Takes the PDF at data/raw/budget.json using PyMuPDF (fitz) to convert each page to an image
2. Sends each page image to Gemini 1.5 Pro vision API
3. For each page, extracts all budget line items as structured JSON with fields: department, sub_department, line_item, current_year_budget, prior_year_budget, change_amount, change_percent
4. Handles pages that are summary pages vs detail pages differently
5. Saves the combined output to data/processed/budget.json
6. Prints progress as it processes each page

Use python-dotenv to load the GEMINI_API_KEY from .env

#  Insights Engine
Create insights.py that reads data/processed/budget.json and computes the following insights:

1. Total budget amount
2. Top 10 departments by budget size with percentages of total
3. Top 5 departments with biggest year-over-year increases (dollar and percent)
4. Top 5 departments with biggest year-over-year decreases
5. General Fund vs Education vs Utilities spending split
6. Per resident cost for top departments (Wallingford population is 45,000)
7. Capital investment total and what it's going toward

Save all insights to data/processed/insights.json
Print a readable summary to console when run

# Q&A agent 
Create agent.py with a function called ask_budget(question: str) -> str that:

1. Loads data/processed/budget.json and insights.json
2. Based on the question, selects only the relevant subset of budget data (not the whole file)
3. Calls Gemini API with this system prompt:

"You are a neutral, helpful budget analyst for Wallingford CT. 
Answer ONLY based on the budget data provided. 
Always cite specific numbers. 
If data is not available, say so clearly. 
Keep answers concise and citizen-friendly, avoid jargon."

4. Returns the answer as a string
5. Include a main() function that runs a simple command line Q&A loop for testing

# Streamit App 
Create app.py as a Streamlit application with:

1. Header: "Wallingford CT Budget Explorer 2025-26"
2. A metrics row showing: Total Budget, vs Prior Year change, Per Resident cost
3. A plotly bar chart of top 10 departments by spending
4. A plotly pie chart of General Fund vs Education vs Utilities split
5. A section titled "Key Insights" that displays the pre-computed insights from insights.json as readable cards
6. A chat interface at the bottom where users can ask questions, powered by agent.py
7. Clean, professional styling — use Wallingford's town colors if possible (blue and white)

Make it look polished, not like a default Streamlit app.
